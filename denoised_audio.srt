00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:02,090
Congratulations to you Mr. Raghavan for that.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:03,430
Thank you so much for joining us.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,231
Over to you.

4
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:09,332
Hi everybody.

5
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:10,053
How are you?

6
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:13,554
I am not hearing this at all.

7
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:16,935
It's like a post-lunch energy downer or something.

8
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:18,716
Let's hear it.

9
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:20,557
Are you guys awake?

10
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:22,317
Alright.

11
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:26,859
You better be because we have a superstar guest here.

12
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:29,310
You heard the $41 million.

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,352
I didn't hear honestly anything that she said after that.

14
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:38,436
So we're going to ask for about $40 million from him by the end of this conversation.

15
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:40,617
But let's get started.

16
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:44,940
I want to introduce Vivek and Pratyush, his co-founder, who's not here.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,863
We wanted to start with playing a video of what Open Hati does.

18
00:00:51,143 --> 00:00:55,366
I encourage all of you to go to the website server.ai and check it out.

19
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:58,207
But let me start by introducing Vivek.

20
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:04,249
Vivek is a dear friend and he is very very modest, one of the most modest guys that I know.

21
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:16,534
But his personal journey Vivek, you got a PhD from Carnegie Mellon, you started and sold a company to Magma and Vivek and I moved back to India, we were both in the valley on the same day actually.

22
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:18,835
And you've been in India for the last 16 years.

23
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:25,132
And what most people don't know is your journey at Aadhaar.

24
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:28,514
He spent 13 years selflessly at Aadhaar.

25
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:29,695
Nobody would have heard of him.

26
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:37,319
But he was a pioneering technology visionary behind Aadhaar, which we all take for granted today.

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,161
So please give it out.

28
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:46,965
So honestly, when I think of selfless service, truly selfless service, I always think of the way.

29
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:54,703
And since then he also was at AI for Bharat, which we're going to touch on with Pratyush's other co-founder.

30
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:57,864
Pratyush had a PhD from ETH at Zurich.

31
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:06,046
He was at IBM Research, he was at Microsoft Research playing a key role and a faculty at IIT Madras and at AI for Bharat.

32
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,626
So that's a little brief introduction about them.

33
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:10,888
These guys are modest, modest engineers.

34
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,309
So they don't toot their own horn.

35
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,992
So forgive me for tooting their horn in this case.

36
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:21,094
But let's jump right in about the money.

37
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,696
Funding, 41 million bucks man.

38
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:25,717
That's a lot of money, right?

39
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:28,559
Every entrepreneur here is saying, what the hell did these guys do?

40
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,561
What did the investors see to write such a big cheque?

41
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:57,652
I think it's a new trend of what's going on in India I think that for the very first time I think investors have looked at you know let's try and build something deep tech out of the country and let's try to figure out how to build something as a foundational technology out of the country and that's really what's really exciting you know and I think that about you know as

42
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:10,541
While I was mentioning for the past 15 years, I've been kind of working in both the digital public infrastructure and non-profit kind of things.

43
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:19,127
But when this whole thing of generative AI came about, we said, OK, how can I actually make a difference in this space?

44
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:25,311
And I said, maybe this is the opportunity to actually come out and really build something.

45
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:29,014
And the only way that we realize that we can do this actually

46
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:45,411
in the private sector and I think that's that and then we when we went out there and we said we want to build something which is a continuation right I mean and fundamentally the question is the reason of what we want to do at Servam AI is we want to basically make generative AI

47
00:03:46,622 --> 00:04:15,858
available and accessible to the people in the country and that's the intent and when we said that we want to do this there was a resonance in the investment community and I think it's a responsibility to really to show that something like this can be built out of India so we see that as confidence and a responsibility and I also hope it's a trend that there are many more people like us who are backed because if you look at it maybe it's a large number in a

48
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:24,905
you know in the Indian context but in the global context I think there is just there should be many many more entrepreneurs who are back to do things in India.

49
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:44,402
I'm going to come back to the many more entrepreneurs I'm obviously going to ask you about Bhavesh's Kuthrin so we're going to come back to the question but again $41 million all of what you said you know $2 million you know that's a good amount of money for a startup which you know which has not yet built anything

50
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:49,094
What are you going to do with all this money?

51
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:50,274
I can solve the problem.

52
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:52,155
I can have a perfect solution for the problem.

53
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:58,157
I think in the last week I've got lots of calls from lots of people telling me how I can do it.

54
00:04:58,517 --> 00:04:59,077
I know you first.

55
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:00,938
We landed in the country the same day.

56
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:01,878
I'm in front of the queue.

57
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:09,424
No, but honestly, I think the key thing in this is, is to putting together an amazing team.

58
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:15,127
And we actually have an amazing team, but believe that it is talent that will drive this kind of thing.

59
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:18,008
And so it is, it is to get, get talent.

60
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:19,709
And of course the other thing is compute.

61
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:25,192
This is extremely expensive compute wise to actually do these kinds of things.

62
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:30,315
And I think that those are the primary things that, that, you know, use this one.

63
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:31,035
Okay.

64
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:34,922
I'm computing in my own head as an entrepreneur.

65
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:37,263
Talent, okay, you have like 20, 50 people.

66
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,464
How much are you paying these guys?

67
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:41,385
You won't touch on that.

68
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:43,667
But let's talk about what you guys actually built.

69
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:44,987
What is open Hati?

70
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:48,669
How would you explain open Hati to many people here who might not have known about it?

71
00:05:49,375 --> 00:06:00,023
So I think OpenHAPI is, so first of all, we come from, I personally come from the open source ecosystem and also from the DPI ecosystem.

72
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:05,307
So we believe that for this to work, we need the ecosystem to be successful.

73
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:08,309
And as a result of that, one of the first things we did was

74
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:12,690
hey, there are these open source large language models that exist, right?

75
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:23,112
I mean, everybody knows about the Llama family from Meta, there are others like Mistral, there are a bunch of open source, you know, large language models.

76
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:30,774
And then we said, is there any way that they can existing open source model and teach it language skills, right?

77
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:37,078
And that is really what we said, can we do something like that?

78
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:47,486
And is this a relatively frugal way of actually making models work in diverse languages?

79
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:54,911
Because the truth is still today, if you look at the amount of data and knowledge, still English dominates these things.

80
00:06:55,311 --> 00:07:05,037
And I think that how do you actually take and make it, understand Indian language, understand Indian context, and all of those things in actually an efficient way.

81
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:07,119
And therefore this was an attempt to do that.

82
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:20,887
And it's an open-hearted, you know, it's currently based on the LAMA 7 billion model, but we'll be releasing many more models in different languages, different sizes, and things like that as part of this series.

83
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:35,319
And of course, you know, we will be building further models on those and doing other things to actually, and we'll also have endpoints that people can use, but it's not, it's definitely, you know, something that can use two things.

84
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,162
And that's the essence of what is open happiness.

85
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:46,868
So what does it mean to people in the audience here who are either doing their own startups or a business or developers?

86
00:07:47,819 --> 00:08:07,416
how should they look at one of the important things that we are doing is we're not just building models we are also building a platform a platform for developers where you can actually use

87
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:25,401
a combination of various different kinds of models, some which are from us, some which are open source, some which may not be open source, and actually to pull together and figure out how to deploy generative AI applications at scale and understand and evaluate their performance.

88
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:28,482
And that's something that we are planning to do.

89
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:35,366
And this platform is, you know, in the next couple of months will be coming out there, be available to developers.

90
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:41,009
But of course, those who want to start with the open source things and act with that, of course, please go ahead.

91
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:43,490
That's phenomenal.

92
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:48,293
How does it compare to OpenAI itself or Google?

93
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:53,167
See, at least the things that we are doing now, right?

94
00:08:53,207 --> 00:09:08,139
I mean, one of the things that when we thought about building server, we said we want to build a full stack general API company and different people and our understanding of stack is that we need to know how to train models from scratch.

95
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,483
We need to know how to kind of figure out how to deploy models to solve real world mistakes.

96
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,344
And we need to play in the ecosystem to make sure that we can actually deploy population scale applications.

97
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:24,845
So we were thinking about all of these things.

98
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:29,388
But still the models we were talking about are fairly small models.

99
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:30,508
They are fairly small models.

100
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,911
The 7 to maybe up to 70 billion kind of range we're talking about.

101
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:39,293
While these models like OpenAI and they're obviously much bigger.

102
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:49,960
But we want to understand the techniques and be able to build that muscle to do all of these things to make it available to people.

103
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:58,926
Now those models are I mean as I said you know I think that there is space for all of those things and I think as when Sridhar was talking about

104
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:23,250
earlier in the day, we believe that these smaller models can do many many kind of domain specific tasks extremely well, probably even better than the larger models and that is really one of the key areas and so therefore the value of these kinds of things, we are not aiming in these more set of models to build any AGI, that's not our goal.

105
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:34,960
Our goal is to make things that work extremely well for domain specific use cases or increase accessibility to language and obviously all of this unique to India.

106
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,441
What is unique about India?

107
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:47,010
Is there anything special in our ecosystem that makes small models focused with Indian languages more suited for our problems?

108
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:53,258
So I think that, I mean, there are quite a few things that are unique about India, right?

109
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:57,803
The first thing is I think that we are a voice first nations.

110
00:10:57,883 --> 00:11:01,367
Therefore, I think voice has to be the core to doing things.

111
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:10,065
The other thing, of course, India is a cost-conscious country from a cost perspective.

112
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:18,710
I would say that there are lots of interesting use cases where you can use OpenAI and the cost structure works depending on your application.

113
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:25,154
But when you want to scale things to a massive level and make it work, then you have to figure out how small amounts work.

114
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:28,276
So that's something that is also specific to India.

115
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:35,781
The third thing which is specific to India is really the success that India has had in building all this digital public infrastructure.

116
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:47,868
When you add the AI layer on top of it, then you can actually get dramatic, you know, dramatic, I think, multiplicative combinatorial effects based on doing things like that.

117
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:48,849
That's a phenomenal point.

118
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,791
Like, you know, it's like DPI to the power of AI almost in some ways.

119
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:55,753
It's a part of Adhar, building Adhar, no better person than you.

120
00:11:57,685 --> 00:12:08,877
So, in summary what I am hearing is small models specialized with trained with big specific language data suited for Indian problems at a compelling cost point will be suited for us.

121
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:12,741
We are not solving some world or some complex problem.

122
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:13,242
We are solving

123
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:37,093
basic problems specifically focus with on voice of multiple languages that is what you see as the future am I paraphrasing this correctly no yeah so I think that certainly I mean a voice at Indian languages are an important part of our strategy but we will be building you know custom models to solve various other kinds of problems as well right it's not just limited to I think in different domains

124
00:12:38,153 --> 00:12:42,819
domains making building things based on unique data that enterprises have.

125
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:45,001
So that's something.

126
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:45,742
Fair enough.

127
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:51,088
So coming back to the elephant in the room, no pun intended with open Hati.

128
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:53,831
What about Bhavesh Atirwal and Kruthiram?

129
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:55,245
What is your take on it?

130
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:56,286
I think it's great.

131
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:58,187
I think it's wonderful, right?

132
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:05,492
I mean the fact that the technology, AI is so important that we need multiple people working on it.

133
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:11,516
The fact that there are other people thinking is actually validates that this is an important problem to be solved.

134
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:17,336
And I think that we need everybody to come together and do that.

135
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:18,978
So I really welcome that.

136
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:20,019
I think it's great.

137
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:26,165
And I think that there will be different people will have different takes as to how to solve this kind of problem.

138
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:30,409
And hopefully as a result of that, the entire ecosystem benefits.

139
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:36,196
I have one more question and then I want to talk about some of the predictions that you boldly made.

140
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:40,497
So Vivek, I usually ask people about what do you think the future will be and everybody usually hedges.

141
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:43,938
I ask Vivek, what do you think is going to happen by December 2024?

142
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:47,899
What do you think sitting in this room one year later we can expect?

143
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,839
And he made three bold predictions.

144
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,580
So I want to talk about that.

145
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,940
Before that I have one last question.

146
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,984
What are the top three applications that you think are relevant for India?

147
00:13:58,364 --> 00:13:59,505
You heard Sridhar talk about medical.

148
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:04,429
Quick summary, what do you think the top three apps are for India for AI?

149
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:15,057
So I mean I think that as I said things like education and medical are clearly areas where I think that can be leveraged.

150
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:16,458
The whole idea of

151
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:22,321
or these kind of the DPI aspect of it is another major application where things can happen.

152
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:24,582
And here I'm talking about country specific work.

153
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:29,985
And I think the whole idea which you also talked about was the concept of software, right?

154
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:36,169
And I think that and clearly we have a very large software industry and how to reimagine those things.

155
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,130
This context is also something that's coming.

156
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:40,011
Fair enough.

157
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:43,653
Are you guys ready for Vivek Radwan's bold predictions?

158
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:44,894
Yeah?

159
00:14:45,462 --> 00:15:11,726
no I'm not hearing any yes this is like a big deal he's like one of the smartest guys that I know he wants to make three predictions you don't want to hear it all right so I asked him what do you think you know here later what what do you think we can expect and he came up with three things and usually people give very blah answers when they ask questions like this because they don't want to be caught wrong not be vague, vague is bold so he basically said three things and I want to list out the three things and then

160
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,100
ask him about it.

161
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:21,326
So number one he says I would prefer to talk to an automated customer service than a real person because they give me a better answer.

162
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,588
That is Vivek Ragwan's prediction number one.

163
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:32,655
So number two is that when everybody is talking about a GPU shortage, Vivek predicts that there will be a GPU glut in India.

164
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:33,776
He thinks there will be too much GPU.

165
00:15:34,953 --> 00:15:37,796
So, if you want a short in-media stock, it's a good time.

166
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:44,162
And number 3, which was extremely unexpected, he said some companies will suddenly die.

167
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,781
not what I expected.

168
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:56,808
So do you want to quickly talk about each of them, why you just came up with these and then we'll throw the audience questions.

169
00:15:56,828 --> 00:16:03,754
So I don't think I quite said it the way that Walai was kind of pointing, but it's interesting.

170
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:12,221
But I think the first thing that we said is I think that, and I don't think that this, I think there will come a time

171
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:17,646
when you know in areas of customer service etc.

172
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,352
when you want to do something very specific.

173
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:30,880
Today, when you call some kind of a bot, you actually end up, you mostly try to disconnect the call or you're extremely upset that you're talking to a bot.

174
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:44,646
But I think that there will come a time, and I'm predicting this sooner than later, that you will actually get better responses from the bot than what the human representative, at least the average human representative that people talk to,

175
00:16:45,106 --> 00:17:07,496
could give and I think that that's just I just said that there will come a time where you know it's not a human you're talking to but it's probably more likely to solve your intent that's just something that that that I think that could happen okay definitely controversial but we let it go what about the GPU glut

176
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:20,649
I think that the fact that there is a tremendous shortage right now, I think that shortage will ease because that is how the cycles of things go.

177
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:34,357
I think the fact that there was such a severe shortage last year basically caused a number of different players to ramp up in various kinds of forms and I think that will always go in cycles.

178
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:39,901
But we may find out that there are many more interesting problems that people will be able to solve.

179
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:55,293
I still remember, you know, we were at a JNEI event in Bangalore and we were talking to people and we said, you know, how many people have access to, you know, four A-hundred?

180
00:17:55,313 --> 00:17:56,554
This was the question that I had asked.

181
00:17:56,855 --> 00:17:57,835
And nobody in the room.

182
00:17:57,855 --> 00:17:59,937
And these are all extremely enthusiastic JNEI people.

183
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:01,452
And nobody had access.

184
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:03,413
And I think that thing is going to change.

185
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:05,434
You will be able to get these kinds of things.

186
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:14,558
And people who want to hack and do things will have access to these things without having to write a check.

187
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:16,739
Vivek is also a semiconductor guy.

188
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,800
Before he went into Adar.

189
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,321
So I would take his predictions very seriously.

190
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:21,421
So I don't know what I would do.

191
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:22,642
I would sell my previous stock.

192
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:24,543
I would not do that.

193
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:25,963
But that's not what I said.

194
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:29,065
I don't want to blame you for this.

195
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:32,450
But the third one is pretty strange.

196
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,957
Companies are born, companies die.

197
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:37,643
But you said some companies will suddenly die.

198
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:38,683
What does that mean?

199
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:46,688
No, I think, see, I think the interesting thing is, and I think that it comes back to the fundamental nature of AI.

200
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:49,050
AI is a tool, right?

201
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,391
And you have to use that.

202
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,493
And you have to use that within your business process, right?

203
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:56,434
And how AI is being used.

204
00:18:56,514 --> 00:19:07,121
And so, and what's going to happen is that, I mean, I think this is true with, you know, when someone said in terms of, you know, people, they said that the people who leverage AI

205
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:11,325
will be more effective than those who don't leverage AI.

206
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:14,107
And that will speak for organizations also.

207
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:22,793
Organizations that leverage AI fundamentally in their core business processes will be more effective than those who don't.

208
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,934
And I think that's the thing.

209
00:19:24,014 --> 00:19:30,178
And you won't know the difference until one day it becomes too obvious and it will be too late.

210
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:36,583
And I think that's the reason why everybody needs to think about what it means for your business.

211
00:19:36,963 --> 00:19:39,164
Because everything will be fine.

212
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:50,848
Everything will be fine and one day somebody in your either competitor in your space or something brand new coming into your space will be reimagining your business process completely.

213
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:56,410
And at that stage you will find that it's a very big, very tall business.

214
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:09,596
you know mountain to climb and that's why I think it's important for both people and entities to think about how they will you know they will upgrade themselves or they will modify their first system.

215
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:16,640
That's a very nuanced answer everybody here running a business should really think about it because life will be the same

216
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:20,616
And then suddenly, suddenly something will be a step change.

217
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:25,178
Vivek, I have a few more questions, but I'm sure the audience has a lot of questions for you.

218
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:26,979
So how are we doing on time?

219
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,580
OK.

220
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,021
So that's OK.

221
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:32,661
A lot of questions, so I'd love to.

222
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,322
Is there a mic that we can?

223
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:40,885
Thank you.

224
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,025
My name is Karthik.

225
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:45,907
I work for IT service industry.

226
00:20:46,897 --> 00:21:07,277
so you're saying that you're working on LLM sorry fine-tuned LLM on top of lama my basic question fundamental question is we don't have a foundational model for India most of the models are basically using English or those kind of things for example even Andrew was talking about

227
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:10,117
tokenizers and things like that.

228
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:17,599
So are you working on anything like that or you want to use mostly the existing models and run on top of it?

229
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:18,700
Good question.

230
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,600
You asked a cherry question for us.

231
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:30,144
No, I think the interesting thing is that if you look at, and we have actually a blog on this, on our website, I think one of the things that we actually built

232
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:58,881
a customized tokenizer which actually fundamentally changes the cost of some of these generations in India languages and I think that we are not just we are actually we are leveraging the existing training but we are doing what's known as continual pre-training which actually but having said that you know I think that once we have to figure out where is the data to train an extremely large model from scratch and some of those things are things which will happen

233
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:00,401
over time.

234
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:06,624
But I think that yes, I think that we will be doing various kinds of things.

235
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:14,347
But the interesting thing is that if I want to change the accessibility problem with an existing open source model, how do I do that?

236
00:22:14,427 --> 00:22:17,728
And that's the problem that we think we have solved.

237
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:20,429
And it's going to be the heart of this.

238
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:23,110
It's extremely well explained in the blog, even I could understand.

239
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,431
Hi, I'm Prashanth.

240
00:22:26,632 --> 00:22:27,792
I work for a fintech company.

241
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:38,654
My question is like, unlike China, we never had a consumer facing application coming out from India and in web one, web two, crypto and on.

242
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:44,135
Why do you think it would be different this time in like AI?

243
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:52,838
Because will the DPI and other things will serve the same purpose what the Great Firewall did in China?

244
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:57,359
Or do you think like, because AI is a strategic sector,

245
00:22:58,186 --> 00:23:05,176
no outside country can work in NASA projects, maybe all government content will go to them.

246
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:08,540
What is at least the mode here for any income?

247
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:15,449
So, I think the question is,

248
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:33,477
I don't know the answer to these questions right I mean I think that it's difficult to predict but I do believe and as I am repeating that the combinatorial effect of reusing Gen AI at a large scale in addition in along with the DPI work that we have done in India

249
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:55,344
will have people and I and I think that in the end it is the intent is that people need to be able to use it and they will vote by things that are useful for them and if that doesn't happen you're right that that I think that we have to figure out what is the mechanism of delivery of apps right I mean how where do Indians consume

250
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:59,170
I am so sorry, but we are out of time.

251
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,550
Vivek will be outside.

252
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,251
So he will be able to answer the question.

253
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:04,412
We have time for one last question.

254
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:06,172
Can I just take one last?

255
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:06,412
Yeah.

256
00:24:07,173 --> 00:24:07,493
Thank you.

257
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:07,933
Thank you.

258
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:08,973
I am Manish Kothari.

259
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:10,654
I am from ISBR Business School.

260
00:24:10,714 --> 00:24:12,875
Good that I got a chance to ask you this question.

261
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:17,777
During lunchtime, there were a few of our educationists whom we were talking about.

262
00:24:17,897 --> 00:24:21,438
There was one from school and we are from the MBA institutions.

263
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:23,899
We were thinking of these present generations.

264
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:26,620
How do we get them into what you are doing?

265
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:39,831
There is one thing that they have been regularly that the concentrations that they are working on but artificial intelligence and getting into this, getting them into their academics and making them a part of it is very important including the trainers who train them.

266
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:46,184
Making them future ready into what you are doing is amazing and the speed that with which is growing.

267
00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:49,646
It is calling for a lot of training that needs to be done.

268
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:54,510
Can you from your angle through some light on how we could make them future ready?

269
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:00,234
How these people who are who are management graduates and from schools who are coming out?

270
00:25:00,695 --> 00:25:03,497
How do we get into this part of technology that you spoke about?

271
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:22,104
This is really a challenge because I think everyone will need to understand at some level what this technology does and I think that we have to rethink how we get everyone into this and that this kind of education has to be at many different levels, right?

272
00:25:22,144 --> 00:25:26,486
There are from a core set of having people who are extremely good

273
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:34,031
And there you don't need as many, but then there are vast numbers of people who can actually leverage these tools.

274
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:44,237
By the way, the most important thing about, and maybe that's part of what makes an LLM interesting, is that how you use it, your mileage varies by that.

275
00:25:44,597 --> 00:25:52,240
And to understand how to actually leverage this in an interesting way is something that we have to widely teach many, many people.

276
00:25:53,420 --> 00:26:03,244
And because asking the things in the right way and having the right kind of applications will make a difference in how people get used to this.

277
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:03,404
Awesome.

278
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:03,864
Thank you.

279
00:26:04,264 --> 00:26:05,605
Thank you very much Vivek.

280
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,646
Very good luck to Sarvam and good luck to India.

281
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,966
I think it's going to be a lot right on your shoulders.

282
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:11,347
Thanks, Vala.

283
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:14,755
Thank you Mr. Raghavan.
